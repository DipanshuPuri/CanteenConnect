# CanteenConnect
CanteenConnect is a lightweight, responsive web platform that streamlines the order placement and management process for university canteens. The goal is to digitize the food ordering system, enabling students to place orders from their devices and view real-time updates, while the canteen staff manage and fulfill orders efficiently from their end.
